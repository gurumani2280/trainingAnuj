Constructor
========

observe difference between constructor and method.

constructor is an special method which is used to construct/create an object

constructor will have same name as className
constructor will never have any returnType
constructor will always be non static 

constructor will be called/invoked/executed whenever an object is created 
using new operator

Every class will have at least one constructor
default constructor by compiler

No default constructor for user defined constructor

why create constructor if there is default constructor?

constructor will always be non static hence it is also called as 
non static intializer which is used to initialize the object

constructor overloading
creating multiple constructor for a class with variation in arguements
	variation in arguments can be achieved in 3 ways
		1. changing the number of arguments
		2. changing the data type of the arguments
		3. changing the position of the arguments

advantages of constructor overloading
	we get multiple options to create the object for a class

Method Overloading
what?
developing multiple method having same name by changing the argument list
is called a method overloading

changing the argument list means
1) changing the number of the arguments
2) changing the data type of the arguments
3) changing the position of the argument

why?
when comman task to be performed with difference in combination of
arguments/input then we should go for method overloading

eg 
login(username, password)
login(mobileNumber, password)

train search

search(PNR)
search(trainNo, trainName)
search(fromStation, toStation)




========-----------======----------=
we can overload both static and non static methods

if the method names are same , then there should be some variation in 
the argument and there is no restrictions
on other parts of the method signature

while overloading method return type can be anything void, int etc

can overload a static and non static method

Q. can we overload main method?

yes, like any other method main method can also be overloaded.
BUt the program execution will start from main method which is 
having arument of (String[] args) -- public static void main(String[] args)
other version of main method should be called/invoked explicitly


advantages of Overloading
----========-------------=
1. we can achieve consistency in method names which are designed 
for commman purpose
2. we can achieve efficiency in program readablity
3. we can remeber method names easily
4. we can achive compile time polymorphism  **

examples
Area -- Addition, Facebook login, fetch train details
Sopln()

in selenium
switchToFrame()
assertEquals()

Java File and multiple classes

In One Java file we can develop multiple classes.
In class in which we develop business logics is called as Business class.
In main class we will write the main method.

If there is multiple classes in a java file, then file name should be main class.

whenever we compiling any java file which is assosiated with multiple classes then
as result of compilation, multiple dot class file will be generated based on class
name.

class Student
{
}

class A
{
}

If you want to acccess the static members of the other class then we should use
that (the other )className.  className.staticMember

if you want to access Non static member of the other class then we should create 
the object of that class.

Multiple static pools will be created based on the className after running java 
program which is assosiated with multiple classes

all the static members of the each class will be loaded on to 
their respective static pool

can we develop multiple main method in one java file?
