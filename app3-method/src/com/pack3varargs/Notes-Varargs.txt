Varargs can make a lot of boilerplate go away in Java.

Varargs are straightforward to use. But there’re a few rules we have to keep in mind:

Rules for varargs:
1. Each method can only have one varargs parameter
2. Variable argument (varargs) must be the last argument.

-VARARG argument is array by default.
// Note:Even though one method is vararg and other is an array both comes under same signature so same method can not be overloaded

Important Points regarding Varargs
1. Vararg Methods can also be overloaded, but overloading may lead to ambiguity.
2. Before JDK 5, variable length arguments could be handled in two ways: One was using overloading, other was using array argument.
3. There can be only one variable argument in a method.
5. Variable argument (Varargs) must be the last argument.
